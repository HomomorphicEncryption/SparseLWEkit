Note: The tools in this table are listed in order of the number of attacks they implement, i.e. the number of check marks. Where the numbers of attacks supported are the same, tools are listed alphabetically.

#### Notes
- 🔒 means that there is an implementation but it is not publicly available.
- ⚠️ means that the tool only partially implements this attack (for example only the non-sparse variant is implemented)

## Parameters Sets

In this section we give examples of some parameter sets and their current security levels.
