#### Notes
- 🔒 means that there is an implementation but it is not publicly available.
- ⚠️ means that the estimator only partially implements this attack (for example only the non-sparse variant is implemented)

## Parameters Sets

In this section we give examples of some parameter sets and their current security levels.
For further information about how the security levels are obtained, please refer the later table comparing the estimation tools.
